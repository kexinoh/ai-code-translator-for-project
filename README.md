中文版请访问（https://github.com/kexinoh/ai-code-translator-for-project/blob/main/readmezh.md）

#  Project Goals:

Automate the translation between codes in mainstream programming languages like Java, Python, C++, etc.
Enhance the accuracy of code translation, ensuring semantic consistency and functional integrity.
Provide a convenient code conversion tool for multilingual development teams to facilitate international collaboration.

# Technical Approach:

Employ advanced natural language processing techniques to parse the syntax and structure of different programming languages.
Establish mappings between programming languages to ensure correct conversion of code logic and functionality.
Develop a user-friendly interface for users to upload source code and receive converted code.
# Expected Outcomes:

A stable and efficient code translation platform.
Support for mutual conversion among various programming languages.
Significant improvement in the efficiency of cross-language development teams.
# Application Scenarios:

Multilingual development collaboration within international companies.
Cooperative projects among developers of different languages in the open-source community.
Learning and teaching of programming languages in the educational field.

# Basic Setup
## 1. Knowledge Base Setup
During the process of language translation, the introduction of new functions and changes to code signatures are inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to design a function knowledge base to store new or already transformed functions. This enables the system to recognize the specific types when these functions are called.

## 2. Use of DAG Graphs
For projects involving multiple files, there are complex reference issues internally. Therefore, using DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) graphs for design allows for gradual updates from the bottom to the top, reducing dependency conflicts.

## 3. Use of CFG Graphs
To accurately implement the transfer of code from the knowledge base, CFG (Control Flow Graph) graphs should be used to extract the functions being called. This ensures that all the function signatures in the code segments are included.

## 4. Test Updates
During updates, it is also necessary to update the test cases, ensuring that the test cases at the current level can be used correctly.

Therefore, the process is as follows:

## Overall Process
DAG scanning to determine the code read-write order --> Code update --> Knowledge base addition --> Test update
